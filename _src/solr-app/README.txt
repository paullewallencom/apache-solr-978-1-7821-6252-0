This directory contains the configuration examples used in the book, divided by chapter. Every folder with the name of a chapter contains a multicore configuration, with all the single examples in that chapter.
Every example is designed to be self-consistent and focused on a single topic or feature, when possible. So there are some repetitions, i hope it's true that 'repetita iuvant' :-).

Note on jar libraries: in most cases the libraries are imported by convention from a /solr directory inside <SolrStarterBook> root dir. It's easy to change this configuration, but if you are unsure on how to do that, i simply reccomend you to unzip the standard Solr distribution under the path <SolrBeginnerBook>/solr.
On the other hand, where an example needs to import external jar libraries, they are generally copied for every example.
